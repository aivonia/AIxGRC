# AixGRC: AI x Governance, Risk & Compliance

This repo documents hands-on AI governance projects built in the cloud. Iâ€™m currently focused on AWS solutions as I study for the AWS Solutions Architect exam.

## ðŸš§ Current Project: AWS GPT Build
Creating a secure, scalable GPT-style assistant using Amazon services. [View progress here.](./aws-gpt-build/README.md)

Follow along or contribute if you're building toward AI accountability, cloud security, or ethical tech systems.
