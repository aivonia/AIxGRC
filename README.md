AIxGRC (Artificial Intelligence x Governance, Risk, and Compliance) is a community-driven initiative committed to strengthening ethical oversight, cybersecurity, and policy readiness in the age of artificial intelligence. We are proudly founded by a veteran, Georgetown graduate student, and ODU alum — and we exist to equip professionals, students, and organizations with the tools and conversations they need to govern AI responsibly.

🎯 Mission
To bridge the gap between rapid AI innovation and the governance needed to keep people safe.

AIxGRC empowers underrepresented voices — from veterans and students to public-sector leaders — with real-world knowledge, resources, and community support. Through workshops, roundtables, mentorship, and open-access templates, we help ensure AI is built and used with transparency, accountability, and human-centered care.

🌍 Vision
A world where AI governance is not an afterthought — but a shared responsibility.

We envision a future where:

Public interest is protected in AI-enabled systems

Cybersecurity and compliance are baked into AI design

Communities, especially in defense, healthcare, and education, are equipped to ask better questions and mitigate real risks

🔑 Our Pillars
Ethical Awareness: Making AI risks and frameworks accessible

GRC Readiness: Promoting practical, scalable risk tools for organizations

Community-Driven Change: Centering veteran, student, and underrepresented voices

Public Sector Focus: Supporting those shaping AI in government, defense, and public health
