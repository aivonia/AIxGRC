# AixGRC

This repository showcases hands-on projects that bridge AI development and Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), using AWS technologies as the foundation.

üõ†Ô∏è I‚Äôm currently focusing on AWS-based solutions as I study for the AWS Solutions Architect certification, building use cases like AI risk registers, GPT-based models, IAM policy auditors, and cloud-native compliance tools. Once comfortable with AWS, I‚Äôll expand to include Azure and GCP examples as well.

## üìö Current Focus: AWS AI Governance Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `aws-gpt-build` | Building a GPT-like chatbot using Amazon Bedrock or SageMaker with API Gateway and Lambda |
| `aws-ai-risk-register` | A cloud-native, exportable risk register for AI model tracking using DynamoDB and Lambda |
| `aws-iam-audit-tool` | AI-assisted IAM permissions analyzer to detect and remediate excessive privileges |
| `aws-s3-encryption-demo` | A walkthrough of secure S3 bucket configurations with encryption, logging, and tagging |
| `aws-vpc-design-lab` | Practice projects for creating secure, isolated VPCs tailored for AI workloads |
| `aws-cloudtrail-monitoring` | Logging and alerting setup for monitoring AI model activity in real time |
| `aws-grc-lambda-automations` | Lambda triggers that automate GRC checks (e.g., flagging PII uploads, alerting misconfigurations) |

## üéØ Purpose

- Make AI governance technical and practical  
- Build compliance-by-design prototypes for future GRC solutions  
- Align projects with HITRUST, HIPAA, NIST 800-53, ISO/IEC 42001, and more  
- Help others see how GRC can be hands-on‚Äînot just policy-driven

## üìå What's Next

Stay tuned as I document each AWS-based project with code, diagrams, and notes on how it supports real-world AI governance challenges. Eventually, this repo will expand to include Azure and Google Cloud examples as well.
