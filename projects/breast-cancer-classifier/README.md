# AIxGRC Project: Breast Cancer Classifier

This project is part of **AIxGRC** ‚Äî a governance-first initiative to demonstrate how artificial intelligence systems can be developed responsibly with embedded governance, risk, and compliance practices.

##  Project Overview

We use a Random Forest classifier to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign using 30 numerical features from scikit-learn‚Äôs `load_breast_cancer` dataset.

While technically simple, this project is designed to show how even baseline ML models can include:

- Ethical and governance documentation
- Transparent model behavior
- Basic risk evaluation
- Reproducible artifacts
