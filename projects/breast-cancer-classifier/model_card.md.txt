# Model Card: Breast Cancer Classifier (AIxGRC Aligned)

## Overview
This model predicts whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign using 30 numerical features from clinical imaging data. The project is part of AIxGRC and demonstrates how machine learning can be documented and risk-aware, even at the proof-of-concept level.

## Intended Use
- For educational and demonstration purposes only.
- Not intended for clinical deployment or medical decision-making.
- Designed to showcase integration of GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) practices into AI development.

## Dataset
- Source: scikit-learn's `load_breast_cancer`
- Total Samples: 569
- Target Classes:  
  - `0` = Malignant  
  - `1` = Benign
- 30 numerical input features per sample

## Performance
- Model: Random Forest Classifier
- Accuracy on Test Set: ~95%
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## Ethical Considerations
- Dataset includes no sensitive or personally identifiable information.
- Class distribution is reasonably balanced: ~37% malignant, ~63% benign.
- Misclassification (especially false negatives) poses high ethical risk in real-world applications.
- No demographic data included (e.g., age, race, clinical context).

## GRC Alignment
- [x] AI Risk Register included
- [x] Model Card documented
- [x] Class distribution analysis included
- [ ] Feature importance visualization (removed for simplicity)
- [ ] Audit logging or live deployment (not applicable)

## Limitations
- No demographic metadata to assess subgroup fairness.
- Small sample size and limited context.
- May overfit on limited clinical indicators without broader validation.
