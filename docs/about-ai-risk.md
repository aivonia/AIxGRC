# ⚠️ Understanding AI Risk

AI systems introduce powerful capabilities — but they also carry complex, often misunderstood risks. As their use spreads across sectors like healthcare, defense, finance, and education, so does the **urgency to govern these systems responsibly**.

## 🤖 What Is AI Risk?

AI risk refers to the **potential harms** or **negative outcomes** that may arise from the design, development, deployment, or use of artificial intelligence systems.

These risks include (but aren’t limited to):

- **Bias & Discrimination**  
  AI trained on incomplete or biased data can reinforce unfair outcomes.

- **Lack of Explainability**  
  “Black box” decisions make it difficult to audit, trust, or challenge outcomes.

- **Data Privacy Violations**  
  AI systems may inadvertently expose sensitive personal information.

- **Security Vulnerabilities**  
  AI can be exploited by adversaries or misused in unintended ways.

- **Regulatory Non-Compliance**  
  New AI laws (e.g., EU AI Act, U.S. Executive Order 14110) require proactive governance.

## 🧭 Why It Matters

Most organizations are adopting AI faster than they can **assess and manage its risks**. That creates:

- Blind spots in procurement and deployment
- Exposure to lawsuits or regulatory fines
- Loss of public trust and reputational harm
- Ethical concerns around fairness and accountability
