# 🎯 AIxGRC Mission & Vision

## 🌍 Mission

AIxGRC exists to bridge the gap between emerging artificial intelligence technologies and ethical, risk-informed governance practices — especially in public sector environments like healthcare, education, and defense.

We aim to democratize access to AI governance knowledge, create practical tools for real-world use, and provide a collaborative space for professionals, students, and policymakers to build trustworthy systems together.

## 🌟 Vision

We envision a world where:
- Artificial intelligence is **transparent**, **accountable**, and **aligned with human values**
- Communities and organizations have the resources to **govern AI safely**
- Risk registers, scoring models, and policy guidance are **accessible to all**
- Students and interns can actively participate in building **ethical innovation from the ground up**

AIxGRC is not just a project — it’s a **movement** for ethical technology stewardship.

## ✊ Our Core Values

- **Openness** — We share knowledge freely and without gatekeeping.
- **Integrity** — We prioritize responsibility and clarity in AI use.
- **Community** — We build in public, with others, for collective good.
- **Impact** — We focus on what creates trust and protects people.

## 🤝 Who This Is For

- University students seeking hands-on AI & GRC experience  
- Government leaders exploring compliance frameworks  
- Nonprofits and civic technologists solving real-world problems  
- Everyday citizens who want to understand and shape AI policy
