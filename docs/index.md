# 🧠 AIxGRC: AI Risk Meets Public Impact

**AIxGRC** is a founder-led initiative focused on helping everyday professionals, public agencies, and concerned citizens understand and manage the risks of artificial intelligence.

We believe that responsible AI starts with awareness — and that governance isn’t just for tech giants or policymakers. It’s for all of us.

## ✨ What We’re Building

AIxGRC is currently in early stages — but we’re starting strong by:

- Hosting local roundtables and community events (starting in Hampton Roads, VA)
- Creating free explainers and frameworks for ethical AI oversight
- Exploring GRC tools that help organizations document and manage AI risk
- Opening the door for students and interns to learn, contribute, and co-build

## 🧭 Why This Matters

We’re witnessing a surge of AI integration in public systems — from healthcare to housing, credit to policing.  
**The risks are real, the rules are vague, and the voices of the people are often missing.**

AIxGRC is here to change that.
